## Porting the game

Before you can port your game into Rojo projects, you need a .rbxlx file. If you have an existing game that isn't a .rbxlx file: 

- Go to studio, click on any place, and then click on File -> Save to file as.

- Click on the drop-down menu where it says "Roblox Place Files (.rbxl)".

- Click on the "Roblox XML Place Files (.rbxlx)", and then click "Save".

- Create a folder and name it whatever you want.

### Steps to port the game:

1. Double-click on rbxlx-to-rojo on wherever you installed it.
2. Select the .rbxlx file you saved earlier.
3. Now, select the folder that you just created.

If you followed the steps correctly, you should see something that looks like this:
